# Secure C Coding for Automotive Systems

## Overview
This project demonstrates common memory vulnerabilities found in embedded C
applications and their secure implementations, with a focus on automotive ECUs.

The goal is to understand how software vulnerabilities can lead to ECU compromise.

## Vulnerabilities Demonstrated
- Buffer Overflow
- Integer Overflow
- Format String Vulnerability
- Use-After-Free
- Double Free

## Secure Coding Techniques
- Bounds checking
- Safe API usage
- Integer validation
- Memory lifecycle management
- Defensive programming practices

## Tools & Technologies
- C programming language
- GCC / Embedded-style compilation
- Linux environment

## Automotive Relevance
- ECU firmware robustness
- Prevention of code execution attacks
- Secure diagnostics and communication handlers

## Learning Outcomes
- Identify dangerous coding patterns
- Apply secure coding practices
- Understand impact of memory bugs in ECUs

## Status
🚧 In progress – code examples and explanations will be added.
